## Description

  This project was created off of the concept of utilizing a fully backend set up in order to generate files for use, allowing for user input upon executing the file to generate a proper professional standard README for use in any potential future projects one may be working on. In fact, this README you are viewing right now was generated from this very repository to begin with!

## Installation

After downloading the repo, you will want to make sure you have the required packages by entering NPM install in the terminal within the directory, from there you will also want to make sure you have node.js in order to execute the repo.

## Usage

Once installed, within the terminal type 'node index.js' in order to initialize the application. From there, answer the prompts as they appear with as much or as little detail you wish to include for the generated README.

## Contributing

Please follow the guidelines and standard set forth by [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) for contributing to the repo.

## Tests

In order to rest the application, simply initalize it as you normally would with 'node index.js' and pass whatever inputs you desire into the prompts as they appear, further uses of the application will overwrite the generated README so long as it remains within the directory, so there is no concern over potential file bloat.
